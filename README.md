# CalculatorApplication 
#https://jim10564.github.io/CalculatorApplication/

This application is a calculatorl, capable of doing simple arithmetic. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made this calculator by creating an HTML table, 
I styled it using CSS, and I coded the logic of the calculator using JavaScript functions, and event handlers. 

Note: this version is not yet optimized for mobile. I will add that at a later date.
